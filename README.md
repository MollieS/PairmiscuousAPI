# PairmiscuousAPI

Building an API using node and express which communicates with a mongo database and an ember frontend.

Task
-----

Basic user stories: 

```
As a maker
I want to be paired with someone
So that I can learn faster

As a bewildered maker
I want to see a list of everyone in my cohort
So that I know who these weird people are

As a promiscuous maker
I want to see a sorted list of people in my cohort that I have/have not paired with
So that I can keep pairing with more people

As a shy maker  
I want a pair partner to be randomly assigned to me  
So that I donâ€™t have to ask them  

As an pairing-loving maker  
I want an option to find a new pair if the pair I am assigned to is away for some reason 
So that I can pair ever day
```
